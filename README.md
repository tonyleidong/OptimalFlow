### Installation
```python
pip install OptimalFlow
```

### Introduction
**OptimalFlow** is an omni-ensemble and scalable automated machine learning Python toolkit, which uses Pipeline Cluster Traversal Experiments(PCTE) and Selection-based Feature Preprocessor with Ensemble Encoding(SPEE), to help data scientists build optimal models, and automate supervised learning workflow with simpler coding.   

**OptimalFlow** wraps the Scikit-learn supervised learning framework to automatically create an ensemble of machine learning pipelines(Omni-ensemble Pipeline Cluster) based on algorithms permutation in each framework component. It includes feature engineering methods in its preprocessing module such as missing value imputation, categorical feature encoding, numeric feature standardization, and outlier winsorization. The models inherit algorithms from Scikit-learn and XGBoost estimators for classification and regression problems. And the extendable coding structure supports adding models from external estimator libraries, which distincts **OptimalFlow** â€™s scalability out of most of AutoML toolkits.

**OptimalFlow** uses *Pipeline Cluster Traversal Experiments* as the optimizer to build an omni-ensemble workflow for an optimal baseline model searching, including feature preprocessing/selection optimization, hyperparameters tuning, model selection and assessment.

After version 0.1.10, it added a "no-code" Web App as an application demo built on **OptimalFlow**. The web app allows simple click and selection for all of the parameters inside of OptimalFLow, which means users could build end-to-end Automated Machine Learning workflow without coding at all!(Read more details https://optimal-flow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/webapp.html)

![WebApp Demo](https://github.com/tonyleidong/OptimalFlow/blob/master/docs/OptimalFlow-WebApp-slow.gif)

Comparing other popular "AutoML or Automated Machine Learning" APIs, **OptimalFlow** is designed as an omni-ensembled ML workflow optimizer with higher-level API targeting to avoid manual repetitive train-along-evaluate experiments in general pipeline building. 

To achieve that, **OptimalFlow** applies *Pipeline Cluster Traversal Experiments* algorithm to assemble all cross-matching pipelines covering major tasks of Machine Learning workflow, and apply traversal-experiment to search the optimal baseline model.

Besides, by modularizing all key pipeline components in reuseable packages, it allows all components to be custom tunable along with high scalability.

The core concept in **OptimalFlow** is *Pipeline Cluster Traversal Experiments*, which is a theory, first raised by Tony Dong during Genpact 2020 GVector Conference, to optimize and automate Machine Learning Workflow using ensemble pipelines algorithm.

Comparing other automated or classic machine learning workflow's repetitive experiments using single pipeline, *Pipeline Cluster Traversal Experiments* is more powerful, with larger coverage scope, to find the best model without manual intervention, and also more flexible with elasticity to cope with unseen data due to its ensemble designs in each component.

In summary, **OptimalFlow** provides the following benefits to data scientists:

* *Easy coding* - High-level APIs to implement PCTE, and each machine learning component is highly automated and modularized;

* *Easy transformation* - Focus on process automation for local implementation, which is easy to transfer current operation and meet compliance restrictions, i.e. pharmaceutical compliance policy;

* *Easy maintenance* - Wrap machine learning components to well-modularized code packages without miscellaneous parameters inside;

* *Light & swift* - Easy to transplant among projects. Quick and convenient, to deploy compared with other cloud-based solutions(i.e. Microsoft Azure AutoML);

* *Omni ensemble* - Easy for data scientists to implement iterated experiments across all ensemble components in the workflow;
      
* *High Scalability* - Each module allows addition of add new algorithms easily owing to its ensemble and reusable coding design. PCTE and SPEE make it easier to adapt unseen datasets with the right pipeline;
      
* *Customization* - Support custom settings to add/remove algorithms or modify hyperparameters for elastic requirements.

### Core Modules: 
 - autoPP for feature preprocessing
